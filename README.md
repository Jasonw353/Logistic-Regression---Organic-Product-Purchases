# Logistic-Regression---Organic-Product-Purchases

The data file for this project is Organics.csv and Python is being used to build a logistic regression model around the following scenario:

A supermarket offers a new line of organic products. The
supermarketâ€™s management wants to determine which customers are likely to purchase these
products. The supermarket has a customer loyalty program. As an initial buyer incentive plan,
the supermarket provided coupons for the organic products to all of the loyalty program
participants and collected data that includes whether these customers purchased any of the
organic products. Based on the data collected, the supermarket wants to understand the
behavior of their customers and their likelihood of purchase of organic products. The
ORGANICS data set contains 8 variables as shown in the table below and more than 22,000
observations
